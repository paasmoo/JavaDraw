## Important info
I have no plans on updating JavaDraw anymore as my coding class is finished for this year. In case you're interested in the grade I got for this project, it's an "A+".

For now the final version of JavaDraw is **V1.5.0**. Feel free to use my code and extend it to your desires. But please credit me if you use it.
